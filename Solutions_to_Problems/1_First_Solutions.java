Here are some beginner problems in Java that you can practice to sharpen your skills. The problems range from simple tasks to slightly more complex ones that involve fundamental concepts in programming. 

1. **Print 'Hello' on screen and your name on a separate line.**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello");
        System.out.println("Your Name");
    }
}
```

2. **Print the sum of two numbers.**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 74, num2 = 36, sum;
        sum = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println("Sum: "+sum);
    }
}
```

3. **Divide two numbers and print them on the screen.**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 50, num2 = 3, result;
        result = num1 / num2;
        System.out.println("Result: "+result);
    }
}
```

4. **Print the results of the following operations.**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(-5 + 8 * 6);
        System.out.println((55+9) % 9);
        System.out.println(20 + -3*5 / 8);
        System.out.println(5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3);
    }
}
```

5. **Take two numbers as input and display the product of two numbers.**
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Input first number: ");
        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Input second number: ");
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(num1 + " x " + num2 + " = " + num1*num2);
    }
}
```
