Certainly! Developing a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms is crucial for becoming a well-rounded programmer. Here are some beginner-level exercises focused specifically on data structures and algorithms:

**Arrays and Strings:**

1. Find the maximum and minimum element in an array.
2. Reverse an array in-place.
3. Check if an array is sorted.
4. Merge two sorted arrays into one.
5. Rotate an array by a given number of positions.
6. Find the most frequent element in an array.
7. Remove duplicates from a sorted array.
8. Implement a basic stack and queue using arrays.
9. Implement a function to check if a string has all unique characters.
10. Implement a function to check if two strings are anagrams.

**Linked Lists:**

1. Implement a singly linked list and perform basic operations (insert, delete, search).
2. Find the middle element of a linked list.
3. Reverse a linked list.
4. Detect if a linked list has a cycle.
5. Merge two sorted linked lists.
6. Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

**Stacks and Queues:**

1. Implement a stack using linked list and perform push, pop operations.
2. Implement a queue using linked list and perform enqueue, dequeue operations.
3. Implement a stack that supports finding the minimum element in O(1) time.
4. Implement a queue using two stacks.
5. Check if a given expression with parentheses is balanced.

**Recursion:**

1. Implement factorial and Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
2. Implement exponentiation using recursion.
3. Write a recursive function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.
4. Calculate the sum of digits of a number using recursion.

**Searching and Sorting:**

1. Implement binary search on a sorted array.
2. Implement bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort.
3. Implement merge sort and quick sort.
4. Find the kth smallest/largest element in an array.

**Hashing:**

1. Implement a simple hash table.
2. Solve the Two Sum problem using a hash map.
3. Implement a frequency counter using a hash map.

**Trees:**

1. Implement a binary search tree and perform insertions and deletions.
2. Traverse a binary tree in preorder, inorder, and postorder.
3. Find the height/depth of a binary tree.
4. Check if a binary tree is balanced.

**Graphs:**

1. Implement a basic graph using adjacency list or adjacency matrix.
2. Perform depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph.
3. Find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.

Remember, the goal of these exercises is not just to find the correct solution but also to understand the underlying principles, trade-offs, and performance characteristics of different algorithms and data structures. It's beneficial to analyze the time and space complexity of your solutions as well. As you work through these exercises, you'll gradually develop a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms that will greatly enhance your problem-solving skills as a programmer.
