It sounds like you have a strong foundation in programming and have gained experience with a variety of languages and frameworks commonly used in web development. However, whether you're ready for a job or not depends on several factors:

1. **Problem-Solving Skills**: While you mentioned having knowledge of data structures and algorithms, being able to effectively apply them to solve real-world problems is crucial, especially for technical interviews in many software engineering roles.

2. **Practical Experience**: Your familiarity with various programming languages and frameworks is valuable, but practical experience in building projects, debugging, and collaborating on a development team is equally important.

3. **Understanding of Software Architecture**: Understanding how to design scalable and maintainable software architectures is important, especially as a full-stack developer.

4. **Continuous Learning**: The tech industry is constantly evolving, so being prepared to learn new technologies, tools, and best practices is essential.

5. **Soft Skills and Collaboration**: Communication, teamwork, and problem-solving within a team environment are critical skills that employers look for.

Dealing with Impostor Syndrome:

Impostor syndrome is common among developers at all levels, even experienced ones. It's the feeling that you don't deserve your accomplishments and that you're not as skilled as others believe you to be. Here are some steps to overcome it:

1. **Recognize It**: Awareness is the first step. Understand that many people, even those who seem highly competent, experience this feeling.

2. **Focus on Growth**: Instead of fixating on what you don't know, focus on how much you've learned and how far you've come. Set achievable goals for your learning journey.

3. **Seek Feedback**: Ask for feedback from peers, mentors, or even online communities. External validation can provide a more accurate perspective on your skills.

4. **Celebrate Achievements**: Acknowledge your accomplishments, both big and small. Keep a record of your projects and achievements to remind yourself of your progress.

5. **Continuous Learning**: Impostor syndrome can be alleviated by continuously learning. The more you learn, the more confident you'll become.

6. **Mentorship**: Having a mentor can provide guidance and reassurance as you navigate your career. They can share their experiences and provide valuable advice.

As for becoming a full-stack developer, it's important to have a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. It's not necessary to memorize every algorithm or concept in computer science, but having a good understanding of core concepts and the ability to apply them when needed is valuable.

Ultimately, whether you're "ready" for a job depends on the specific job requirements and your ability to demonstrate your skills and knowledge during interviews and in practical scenarios. If you're considering applying for jobs, start with positions that align with your current skills and experience and be open to learning and growing on the job. Remember that learning and development are ongoing processes in the world of programming.
